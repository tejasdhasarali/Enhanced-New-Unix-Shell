# Enhanced-New-Unix-Shell
* Enhanced New Unix Shell is an application written in C++ which mimics the functionalities of the Unix shell.

* It supports all the Unix commands and some of the commands like cd, exit, pwd, and set are built inside the application.

* New command myls was also added to the existing pool of Unix commands to mimic the functionality of 'ls-l', this can be seen in the file myls.cpp.

* The path can be set for myls command using the set, which is built inside the application. The command for setting the path is " set MYPATH=*path* ", which creates a text file called MyPath and saves the path.

* The application also supports piped commands, IO redirection, and background command execution.
